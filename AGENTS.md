# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `backend/`: FastAPI service. Main app code lives in `backend/app/` with API routes in `backend/app/api/`, data models in `backend/app/models/`, schemas in `backend/app/schemas/`, service logic in `backend/app/services/` (core OpenClaw gateway RPC and provisioning in `backend/app/services/openclaw/`), and DB utilities in `backend/app/db/`.
- `backend/migrations/`: Alembic migrations (`backend/migrations/versions/` for generated revisions).
- `backend/tests/`: pytest suite (`test_*.py` naming).
- `backend/templates/`: backend-shipped templates used by gateway flows.
- `frontend/`: Next.js app. Routes under `frontend/src/app/`, shared components under `frontend/src/components/`, utilities under `frontend/src/lib/`.
- `frontend/src/api/generated/`: generated API client; regenerate instead of editing by hand.
- `docs/`: contributor and operations docs (start at `docs/README.md`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make setup`: install/sync backend and frontend dependencies.
- `make check`: closest CI parity run (lint, typecheck, tests/coverage, frontend build).
- `docker compose -f compose.yml --env-file .env up -d --build`: run full stack.
- Fast local loop:
  - `docker compose -f compose.yml --env-file .env up -d db`
  - `cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
  - `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- `make api-gen`: regenerate frontend API client (backend must be on `127.0.0.1:8000`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python: Black + isort + flake8 + strict mypy. Max line length is 100. Use `snake_case`.
- TypeScript/React: ESLint + Prettier. Components use `PascalCase`; variables/functions use `camelCase`.
- For intentionally unused destructured TS variables, prefix with `_` to satisfy lint config.

## Testing Guidelines
- Backend: pytest via `make backend-test`; coverage policy via `make backend-coverage` (writes `backend/coverage.xml` and `backend/coverage.json`).
- Frontend: vitest + Testing Library via `make frontend-test` (coverage in `frontend/coverage/`).
- Add or update tests whenever behavior changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits (seen in history), e.g. `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `test(core): ...`.
- Keep PRs focused and based on latest `master`.
- Include: what changed, why, test evidence (`make check` or targeted commands), linked issue, and screenshots/logs when UI or operator workflow changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Copy from `.env.example` and keep real values in local `.env`.
- Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub security advisories, not public issues.
